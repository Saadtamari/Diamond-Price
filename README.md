# Diamond-Price Prediction ðŸ’Ž
This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for practise your learning about data analysis and visualization.

Content :
1. price price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)
2. carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)
3. cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
4. color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
5. clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
6. x length in mm (0--10.74)
7. y width in mm (0--58.9)
8. z depth in mm (0--31.8)
9. depth total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
10. table width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

# In this project we did the following :

## 1.Importing & Reading.
The first thing we did it is importing all libraries & models that we will use it later
Then we read the training & testing data and show it.
it was contains of 11 columns : [Id,	carat,	cut,	color,	clarity,	depth,	table,	price,	x,	y,	z]

## 2.EDA.


## 3.Preparing the data.

## 4.Feature Engineering.

## 5.Building models & Compare them.

## 6.Select the best model.
